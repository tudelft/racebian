# racebian

Pi-Zero Companion Computer for Betaflight

## Connecting to the Pi

Tested for Ubuntu 22.04 host computer. First install these packages:
```bash
sudo apt install make iptables net-tools arch-test
```

Then clone this repo, and install the custom commands and services:
```bash
sudo make install-pi-tools
```

1. Flash a `Racebian` image from `https://github.com/tblaha/racebian/releases` or build yourself (see below).
2. Power the PI and connect to the WIFI network it hosts
    - SSID is `racebian` by default, password `betaflight`.
    - Can be configured in `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf` if you mount the flashed SD card (or in `./config` of this repo, if you build the image yourself)
    - you can now connect via `ssh pi@10.0.0.1` with password `pi`
3. ~~To expose the Pi zero's USB port to your local laptop, just start the service~~ Version 0.4.0: we are now using `ser2net` to tunnel the serial USB via TCP which doesn't need client configuration and is more stable
    - `sudo systemctl start pi-usb-attach`
    - if it ever acts up, just restart with `sudo systemctl restart pi-usb-attach`
4. To let the Pi access all other networks of the laptop client:
    - `sudo pi-routing-up 10.0.0.1`
    - (to restrict to only a certain interface, do `sudo pi-routing-up --iface=<INTERFACE> 10.0.0.1`)
5. ~~if the Pi still doesn't have internet/optitrack connection try this:~~ (should be fixed in 0.2.0!)
    - on the Pi, run `sudo route add default gw 10.0.0.<your_laptop_ip> wlan0`
    - you can find the laptop ip by running `ip a | grep 10.0.0.` on the laptop.


## Debugging / Flashing an SWD-capable microcontroller via the Pi

This is relatively easy to setup and super useful. See [README_SWD.md](README_SWD.md).


## Downloading files from USB mass storage device

When connecting a USB mass storage device (such as a flight controller in MSC mode), `ser2net` cannot forward this, because a USB MSC device is not serial (but rather appears as a disk such as `/dev/sda`). A neat way to download data from this is to mount the storage device, and use `rsync` to download via `ssh`. An example script that can be used as a VS Code task is provided in [usb-download](usb-download).



## Optional: Building the image

TODO --> dockerize this, so we don't have to deal with dependency hell

### Prerequesites

Tested on Ubuntu 22.04. First install these packages:
```bash
sudo apt install coreutils quilt parted qemu-user-static debootstrap zerofree \
    zip dosfstools libarchive-tools libcap2-bin grep rsync xz-utils file git curl \
    bc qemu-utils kpartx gpg pigz make git bc bison flex libssl-dev make libc6-dev \
    libncurses5-dev crossbuild-essential-arm64 \
    linux-tools-virtual linux-tools-$(uname -r) hwdata \
```

<!--
Also, to cross-compile the RT kernel:
```bash
sudo apt install git bc bison flex libssl-dev make libc6-dev libncurses5-dev crossbuild-essential-arm64
```

To use BF configurator via usb forwarding later, install this:
```bash
sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual linux-tools-$(uname -r) hwdata
```
-->

Generate the default locale used in the pi images (which we'll keep):
```bash
sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
```

Then clone this repo *in an ext2 or ext4 filesystem, NOT NTFS*:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:tblaha/racebian.git
```

### Building

Build the image *with a stable Ethernet connection* (it didnt find some packages when I tried via wifi and quit). The build script uses change-root. Do not interrupt it with CTRL-C or else you may have to reboot your system.
```bash
# sudo make clean # optional
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 sudo make pi-image-racebian
```

### Flashing

Flash the image. Take extreme care with this command, as it can break your system.
```bash
sudo umount /dev/mmcblk*
sudo dd bs=4M if=./build/pi-img/bin/<NAME OF THE IMAGE> of=/dev/<SD CARD DEVICE, NOT PARTITION, ENDS IN blkX> status=progress
```

## TODO:

- [x] remove the cross compiled BF-configurator, if usbip works.
- ~~[ ] write ansible playbooks for uploading betaflight `hex` files~~ no need thanks to `usbip`
- [ ] dockerize this to eliminate build-system dependencies
- [x] add betaflight_race receiver and optitrack code
- ~~[ ] put `make pi-attach-usb` commands in pre-start/post-exit hooks of the systemd service~~
- [x] reformulate more `make` commands as actual commands, maybe with a `pi-util` shell or python script
